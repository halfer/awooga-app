		<h3>
			What's the current focus?
		</h3>
		<p>
			Presently it's PHP tutorials, because that's what I know, and because there is a lot
			of material out there that needs improvement. But if we can get some solid subject
			experts for other languages, that would be great too.

		<h3>
			Can I reuse Awooga data?
		</h3>
		<p>
			All data in Awooga is owned by the community, and should be regarded as copyleft. I'll
			look into choosing a license for it, possibly Creative Commons. If you want to re-use
			the data in your own project, great. Get in touch, and I'll see if I can help.

		<h3>
			Are there alternatives to maintaining a repository?
		</h3>
		<p>
			I chose public Git repositories because they're a login that most developers already
			have. However, if you don't want to maintain your own report set, you could instead
			fork an existing one, and send a pull request to the owner.

			Can we add and edit resources online?
		</h3>
		<p>
			A couple of people have requested that already, so I'll be looking at that next.
